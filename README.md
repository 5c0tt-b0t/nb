# `‚ùØ nb`

`nb` is a command line note-taking, bookmarking, archiving, and research
management tool with encryption, advanced search,
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)-backed versioning and syncing,
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)-backed conversion,
global and local notebooks, tagging, customizable color themes,
plain-text data storage, and more, all in a single portable script.

`nb` creates notes in text-based formats like
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
[Emacs Org mode](https://orgmode.org/),
and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/),
can work with files in any format, can import and export notes to many
document formats, and can create private, password-protected encrypted
notes and bookmarks. With `nb`, you can add and edit notes using Vim, Emacs,
VS Code, Sublime Text, and any other text editor you prefer. `nb` works in
any standard Linux / Unix environment, including macOS and Windows via WSL.
[Optional dependencies](#optional) can be installed to enhance functionality,
but `nb` works great without them.

<p align="center">
  <img 	src="https://xwmx.github.io/misc/nb/images/nb-theme-nb-home.png"
  	   	alt="home"
  	   	width="450"/>
</p>

`nb` is also a powerful text-based CLI bookmarking system that includes:

- local full-text search of cached page content with regular expression support,
- tagging,
- convenient filtering and listing,
- [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) snapshot lookup for
  broken links,
- and easy viewing of bookmarked pages in the terminal and your regular web browser.

Page information is automatically downloaded, compiled, and saved into normal Markdown
documents made for humans, so bookmarks are easy to edit just like any other note.

  <img 	src="https://xwmx.github.io/misc/nb/images/nb-theme-raspberry-bookmarks.png"
  		  alt="bookmarks"
  		  width="450"/>
</p>

`nb` uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in the background to automatically
record changes and sync with a remote repository, if one has been configured.
`nb` can also be configured to save notes in a location used by a general
purpose syncing utility like Dropbox so they can be edited in other apps on
any device.

  		  alt="bookmarks"
  		  width="450"/>
</p>

`nb` is designed to be portable, future-focused, and vendor independent,
providing a full-featured, intuitive, and enjoyable experience within a
user-centric text interface.
The entire program is a single well-tested shell script
that can be copied or `curl`ed almost anywhere and just work, using
[progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
for various experience improvements in more capable environments.
`nb` makes it easy to incorporate other tools, writing apps, and workflows.
`nb` can be used a little, a lot, once in a while, or for just a subset of
features. `nb` is flexible.

### Installation

Most installation methods below should work in most Linux and BSD
environments.

When installing with Make or using the manual commands on Ubuntu, WSL,
and Alpine Linux, the recommended dependencies will also be installed,
along with Bash and Zsh completion scripts.

#### macOS / Homebrew

To install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install xwmx/taps/nb
```

Installing `nb` with Homebrew also installs the recommended dependencies
and completion scripts.

#### Ubuntu, Windows WSL, Alpine, and others

##### npm

To install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notes.sh):

```bash
npm install --global notes.sh
```

Note: Installing through `npm` only installs completion scripts.
On Ubuntu, WSL, and Alpine, you can
run `nb env install` to install the optional dependencies.

##### bpkg

To install with [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg):

```bash
bpkg install xwmx/nb
```

##### Make

To install with [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)),
clone this repository, navigate to the clone's root directory, and run:

```bash
make install
```

Depending on your system configuration, `sudo` might be required:

```bash
sudo make install
```

To install as an administrator, copy and paste one of the following multi-line
commands:

```bash
# install using wget
sudo wget https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -O /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo nb env install

# install using curl
sudo curl -L https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -o /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nb &&
  sudo nb env install
```

Manually installed copies of `nb` can be updated using the `nb update`
command.

###### User-only Installation

To install with just user permissions, simply add the `nb` script to your
`$PATH`. If you already have a `~/bin` directory, for example, you can use
one of the following commands:

```bash
# download with wget
wget https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -O ~/bin/nb && chmod +x ~/bin/nb

# download with curl
curl -L https://raw.github.com/xwmx/nb/master/nb -o ~/bin/nb && chmod +x ~/bin/nb
```

#### Tab Completion

Bash and Zsh tab completion should be enabled when `nb` is installed using
the methods above, assuming you have the appropriate system
permissions or installed with `sudo`. If completion isn't working after
installing `nb`, see the [completion installation
instructions](etc/README.md).

</p>

To get started, simply run:

```bash
nb
```

`nb` stores notes in notebooks, and `nb` sets up your initial "home" notebook
the first time it runs.

By default, notebooks and notes are global (at `~/.nb`), so they are always available to
`nb` regardless of the current working directory. `nb` also supports [local
notebooks](#global-and-local-notebooks).

### üìù Working with Notes

#### Adding Notes

Use `nb add` to create new notes:

```bash
# create a new note in your text editor
nb add

# create a new note with the filename 'example.md'
nb add example.md

# create a new note containing "This is a note."
nb add "This is a note."

# create a new note with piped content
echo "Note content." | nb add

# create a new password-protected, encrypted note
nb add --title "Secret Document" --encrypt
```

`nb add` with no arguments or input will open the new, blank note in your
environment's preferred text editor. You can change your editor using the
`$EDITOR` environment variable or [`nb settings`](#settings).

`nb` files are [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
files by default. To change the file type, see `nb help add`.

Password-protected notes are encrypted with AES-256 using OpenSSL by
default. GPG is also supported and can be configured in `nb settings`.
Encrypted notes can be decrypted using the OpenSSL and GPG command line
tools directly, so you aren't dependent on `nb` to decrypt your
files.

##### Shortcut Alias: `a`

`nb` includes single-character shortcuts for many commands, including
`a` for `add`:

```bash
# create a new note in your text editor
nb a

# create a new note with the filename 'example.md'
nb a example.md

# create a new note containing "This is a note."
nb a "This is a note."
```

#### Listing Notes

To list notes and notebooks, run `nb ls`:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[3] example.md ¬∑ "Example content."
[2] todos.md ¬∑ "Todos:"
[1] ideas.md ¬∑ "- Example idea one."
```

Notebooks are listed above the line, with the current notebook
highlighted and/or underlined, depending on terminal capabilities.

Notes from the current notebook are listed in the order they were last
modified. By default, each note is listed with its id, filename, and an
excerpt from the first line of the note. When a note has a title, the
title is displayed instead of the filename and first line.

Titles can be defined within a note using
[either Markdown `h1` style](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header)
or [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```markdown
# Example Title
```

```markdown
Todos
=====
```

```markdown
---
title: Ideas
---
```

Once defined, titles will be displayed in place of the filename and first line
in the output of `nb ls`:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
[1] Ideas
```

Pass an id, filename, or title to view the listing for that note:

```bash
> nb ls Todos
[2] Todos
```

```bash
> nb ls 3
[3] Example Title
```

If there is no immediate match, `nb` will list items with titles and
filenames that fuzzy match the query:

```bash
> nb ls 'idea'
[1] Ideas
```

A case-insensitive regular expression can also be to filter filenames and
titles:

```bash
> nb ls '^example.*'
[3] Example Title
```

For full text search, see `nb help search`.

To view excerpts of notes, use the `--excerpt` or `-e` option:

```bash
> nb ls 3 --excerpt
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt.
```

Bookmarks and encrypted notes are indicated with `üîñ` and `üîí`, making them
easily identifiable in lists:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[4] Example Note
[3] üîí example-encrypted.md.enc
[2] üîñ Example Bookmark (example.com)
[1] üîñ üîí example-encrypted.bookmark.md.enc
```

`nb` with no subcommand is an alias for `nb ls`, so the examples above
can be run without the `ls`:

```bash
> nb
home
----
[3] Example Title
[2] Todos
[1] Ideas

> nb '^example.*'
[3] Example Title

> nb 3 --excerpt
[3] Example Title
-----------------
# Example Title

This is an example excerpt
```

On most systems, when the list of notes is longer than the terminal
can display on one screen, `nb ls` will open the list in
[`less`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix)). Use the following
keys to navigate in `less` (see [`man less`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less)
for more information):

```text
Key               Function
---               --------
mouse scroll      Scroll up / down
arrow up / down   Scroll one line up / down
f                 Move forward one page
b                 Move back one page
/<query>          Search for <query>
n                 Jump to next <query> match
q                 Quit
```

`nb ls` is a combination of `nb notebooks` and `nb list` in one view
and accepts the same arguments as `nb list`, which lists only notes.

For more information about options for listing notes, run `nb help ls` and
`nb help list`.

#### Editing Notes

You can edit a note in your editor using its id, filename, or title:

```bash
# edit note by id
nb edit 3

# edit note by filename
nb edit example.md

# edit note by title
nb edit 'A Document Title'
```

`nb edit` can also receive piped content, which it will append to the
specified note:

```bash
echo "Content to append." | nb edit 1
```

When a note is encrypted, `nb edit` will prompt you for the note password,
open the unencrypted content in your editor, and then automatically reencrypt
the note when you are done editing.

##### Shortcut Alias: `e`

Like `add`, `edit` has a shortcut alias, `e`:

```bash
# edit note by id
nb e 3

# edit note by filename
nb e example.md

# edit note by title
nb e 'A Document Title'
```

#### Viewing Notes

Notes can be viewed using `nb show`:

```bash
# show note by id
nb show 3

# show note by filename
nb show example.md

# show note by title
nb show 'A Document Title'
```

By default, `nb show` will open the note in
[`less`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less), with syntax highlighting if
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) is installed, and you can navigate with the
same keys used in `nb ls`:

```text
Key               Function
---               --------
mouse scroll      Scroll up / down
arrow up / down   Scroll one line up / down
f                 Move forward one page
b                 Move back one page
/<query>          Search for <query>
n                 Jump to next <query> match
q                 Quit
```

When [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is available, use the `--render` option to
render the note to HTML and open it in your terminal browser:

```bash
nb show example.md --render
# opens example.md as an HTML page in w3m or lynx
```

`nb show` also supports previewing other file types in the terminal,
depending on the tools available in the environment. Supported tools
and file types include:

- [`pdftotext`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext) - PDF files
- [`mplayer`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer),
  [`afplay`](https://ss64.com/osx/afplay.html),
  [`mpg123`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpg123),
  [`ffplay`](http://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) - Audio files
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/),
  [`imgcat`](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-images.html),
  [kitty's `icat` kitten](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html) - Images
- [`ranger`](https://ranger.github.io/),
  [`mc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander) - Folders /
  Directories

When using `nb show` with other file types or if the above tools are not
available, `nb show` will open files in your system's preferred application
for each type.

`nb show` is primarily intended for previewing notes and files within
the terminal. To view files in the system's preferred GUI application,
use [`nb open`](#import--export).

##### Shortcut Alias: `s`

`show` is aliased to `s`:

```bash
# show note by id
nb s 3

# show note by filename
nb s example.md

# show note by title
nb s 'A Document Title'
```

#### Deleting Notes

Deleting notes works the same, accepting an id, filename, or title to
specify the note:

```bash
# delete note by id
nb delete 3

# delete note by filename
nb delete example.md

# delete note by title
nb delete 'A Document Title'
```

By default, `nb delete` will display a confirmation prompt. To skip, use the
`--force` / `-f` option:

```bash
nb delete 3 --force
```

##### Shortcut Alias: `d`

`delete` has the alias `d`:

```bash
# delete note by id
nb d 3

# delete note by filename
nb d example.md

# delete note by title
nb d 'A Document Title'
```

### üîñ Bookmarks

`nb` is a powerful bookmark management system, enabling you to to view, search,
and manage your bookmarks, links, and online references. Bookmarks are
Markdown notes containing information about the bookmarked page.

To create a new bookmark pass a URL as the first argument to `nb`:

```bash
nb https://example.com
```

`nb` automatically generates a bookmark using information from the page:

```markdown
# Example Domain (example.com)

<https://example.com>

## Description

Example meta description.

## Content

Example Domain
==============

This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may
use this domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for
permission.

[More information\...](https://www.iana.org/domains/example)
```

`nb` embeds the page content in the bookmark, making it available for full
text search with `nb search` and `nb bookmark search`. When `pandoc` is
installed, the HTML page content will be converted to Markdown.

Bookmarks can be tagged using the `--tags` option. Tags are converted
into hashtags:

```bash
nb https://example.com --tags tag1,tag2
```
```markdown
# Example Domain (example.com)

<https://example.com>

## Description

Example meta description.

## Tags

#tag1 #tag2

## Content

Example Domain
==============

This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may
use this domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for
permission.

[More information\...](https://www.iana.org/domains/example)
```

Search for tagged bookmarks with `nb bookmark search`:

```bash
nb bookmark search '#tagname'
```

`nb bookmark search` has the same full text search as `nb search`.
Search both bookmarks and notes for tags with `nb search`:

```bash
nb search '#tagname'
```

`nb bookmark search` and `nb search` also automatically search archived
page content:

```bash
> nb bookmark search 'example query'
[10] example.bookmark.md 'Example Bookmark (example.com)'
---------------------------------------------------------
5:Lorem ipsum example query.
```

Bookmarks can also be encrypted:

```bash
# create a new password-protected, encrypted bookmark
nb https://example.com --encrypt
```

Encrypted bookmarks require a password before they can be viewed or
opened.

`nb bookmark` and `nb bookmark list` can be used to list and
filter bookmarks:

```bash
> nb bookmark
Add: nb <url> Help: nb help bookmark
------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí Example Three (example.com)
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> nb bookmark list two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

##### Shortcut Alias: `b`

`bookmark` can also be used with the alias `b`:

```bash
> nb b
Add: nb <url> Help: nb help bookmark
------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí Example Three (example.com)
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> nb b two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

#### Opening Bookmarks

`nb` provides multiple ways to view bookmarked web pages.

`nb bookmark open` and `nb open` open the bookmarked page in your
system's primary web browser:

```bash
# open bookmark by id
nb open 3
```

`nb bookmark peek` and `nb peek` open the bookmarked page in your
terminal web browser:

```bash
# peek bookmark by id
nb peek 12
```

When used with bookmarks, `nb open` and `nb peek` are aliases for
`nb bookmark open` and `nb bookmark peek`.

`open` and `peek` subcommands also work seamlessly with encrypted bookmarks.
`nb` will simply prompt you for the bookmark's password.

`open` and `peek` automatically check whether the URL is still valid.
If the page has been removed, `nb` can check the [Internet Archive
Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) for an archived copy.

##### Shortcut Aliases: `o` and `p`

`open` and `peek` can also be used with the shortcut aliases `o` and
`p`:

```bash
# open bookmark by id
nb o 3

# peek bookmark by id
nb p 12
```

#### Bookmark File Format

Bookmarks are identified by a `.bookmark.md` file extension. The
bookmark URL is the first URL in the file within `<` and `>` characters.
To create a minimal valid bookmark file with `nb add`:

```bash
nb add example.bookmark.md --content "<https://example.com>"
```

#### `bookmark` -- A command line tool for managing bookmarks.

`nb` includes `bookmark`, a full-featured, streamlined command line
interface for creating, viewing, searching, and editing bookmarks.

Bookmark a page:

```bash
> bookmark https://example.com --tags tag1,tag2
Added [3] 20200101000000.bookmark.md 'Example Domain (example.com)'
```
List and filter bookmarks with `bookmark` and `bookmark list`:

```bash
> bookmark
Add: bookmark <url> Help: bookmark help
---------------------------------------
[3] üîñ üîí Example Three (example.com)
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
[1] üîñ Example One (example.com)

> bookmark list two
[2] üîñ Example Two (example.com)
```

View a bookmark in your terminal web browser:

```bash
> bookmark peek 2
```

Open a bookmark in your system's primary web browser:

```bash
> bookmark open 2
```

Perform a full text search of bookmarks and archived page content:

```bash
> bookmark search 'example query'
[10] example.bookmark.md 'Example Bookmark (example.com)'
---------------------------------------------------------
5:Lorem ipsum example query.
```

`bookmark` is a shortcut for `nb bookmark`, accepts all of the same
subcommands and options, and behaves identically.

See [`bookmark help`](#bookmark-help) for more information.

### üîç Search

Use `nb search` to search your notes, with support for regular
expressions and tags:

```bash
# search current notebook for 'example query'
nb search 'example query'

# search all notebooks for 'example query'
nb search 'example query' --all

# search nb for 'Example' OR 'Sample'
nb search 'Example|Sample'

# search for nb containing the hashtag '#example'
nb search '#example'

# search with a regular expression for nb containing phone numbers
nb search '^(1?(-?\d{3})-?)?(\d{3})(-?\d{4})$'

# search bookmarks for 'example'
nb search 'example' --type bookmark
```

`nb search` prints the id number, filename, and title of each matched
file, followed by each search query match and its line number, with color
highlighting:

```bash
> nb search 'example'
[314]  example.bookmark.md 'Example Bookmark (example.com)'
----------------------------------------------------------
1:# Example Bookmark (example.com)

3:<https://example.com>

[2718] example.md 'Example Note'
--------------------------------
1:# Example Note
```

To just print the note information line without the content matches, use
the `-l` or `--list` option:

```bash
> nb search 'example' --list
[314]  example.bookmark.md 'Example Bookmark (example.com)'
[2718] example.md 'Example Note'
```

`nb search` looks for [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep),
[`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher),
[`ack`](http://beyondgrep.com/), and
[`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), in that order, and
performs searches using the first tool it finds. `nb search` works
mostly the same regardless of which tool is found and is perfectly fine using
the environment's built-in `grep`. `rg`, `ag`, and `ack` are faster and there
are some subtle differences in color highlighting.

##### Shortcut Alias: `q`

`search` can also be used with the alias `q` (for "query"):

```bash
# search for 'example' and print matching excerpts
nb q 'example'

# search for 'example' and list each matching file
nb q -l 'example'
```

### Revision History

Whenever a note is added, modified, or deleted, `nb` automatically commits
the change to git transparently in the background. You can view the history of
the notebook or an individual note with:

```bash
# show history for current notebook
nb history

# show history for note number 4
nb history 4

# show history for note with filename example.md
nb history example.md

# show history for note titled 'Example'
nb history Example
```

`nb history` uses `git log` by default and prefers
[`tig`](https://github.com/jonas/tig) when available.

### üìî Notebooks

You can create additional notebooks, each of which has its own version history.

Create a new notebook:

```bash
# add a notebook named example
nb notebooks add example
```

`nb` and `nb ls` list the available notebooks above the list of notes:

```bash
> nb ls
example ¬∑ home
--------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

Commands in `nb` run within the current notebook, and identifiers like id,
filename, and title refer to notes within the current notebook.
`nb edit 3`, for example, tells `nb` to `edit` note with id `3` within the
current notebook.

To switch to a different notebook, use `nb use`:

```bash
# switch to the notebook named 'example'
nb use example
```

If you are in one notebook and you want to perform a command in a
different notebook without switching to it, add the notebook name with a
colon before the command name:

```bash
# show note 5 in the notebook named 'example'
nb example:show 5
```

You can similarly set the notebook name as a modifier to the id, filename, or
title:

```bash
# edit note 12 in the notebook named 'example'
nb edit example:12
```

When a notebook name is specified without a command, `nb` runs `nb ls` in the
specified notebook:

```bash
> nb example:
example ¬∑ home
--------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

Notes can also be moved between notebooks:

```bash
# move note 3 from the current notebook to 'example'
nb move 3 example
```

#### Global and Local Notebooks

##### Global Notebooks

By default, all `nb` notebooks are global, making them always accessible in
the terminal regardless of the current working directory. Global notebooks are
stored in the directory configured in [`NB_DIR`](#settings-list---long), which is
`~/.nb` by default.

##### Local Notebooks

`nb` also supports creating and working with local notebooks. Local
notebooks are notebooks that are anywhere on the system outside
of `NB_DIR`. When `nb` runs within a local notebook, the local
notebook is set as the current notebook:

```bash
> nb ls
local ¬∑ example ¬∑ home
----------------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

A local notebook is always referred to by the name `local` and otherwise
behaves just like a global notebook whenever a command is run from within it:

```bash
# move note titled 'Todos' from the home notebook to the local notebook
nb move home:Todos local

# move note 1 from the local notebook to the home notebook
nb move 1 home

# search the local notebook and all global notebooks for <query string>
nb search 'query string' --all
```

Local notebooks can be created with [`nb notebooks init`](#notebooks-1):

```bash
# initialize the current directory as a notebook
nb notebooks init

# create a new notebook at ~/example
nb notebooks init ~/example

# clone an existing notebook to ~/example
nb notebooks init ~/example https://github.com/example/example.git
```

Local notebooks can also be created by exporting a global notebook:

```bash
# export global notebook named 'example' to '../path/to/destination'
nb notebooks export example ../path/to/destination
```

Local notebooks can also be imported, making them global:

```bash
# import notebook or folder at '../path/to/notebook'
nb notebooks import ../path/to/notebook
```

#### Archiving Notebooks

Notebooks can be archived:

```bash
# archive the current notebook
nb notebooks archive

# archive the notebook named 'example'
nb notebooks archive example
```

When a notebook is archived it is not included in `ls` output, synced
automatically with `sync --all`, or included in `search --all`.

```bash
> nb ls
example1 ¬∑ example2 ¬∑ example3 ¬∑ [1 archived]
---------------------------------------------
[3] Title Three
[2] Title Two
[1] Title One
```

Archived notebooks can still be used individually using normal notebook
commands:

```bash
# switch the current notebook to the archived notebook 'example'
nb use example

# run the `list` subcommand in the archived notebook 'example'
nb example:list
```

Check a notebook's archival status with `nb notebooks status`:

```bash
> nb notebooks status example
example is archived.
```

Unarchiving a notebook is simple:

```bash
# unarchive the current notebook
nb notebooks unarchive

# unarchive the notebook named 'example'
nb notebooks unarchive example
```

For more information about working with notebooks, run `nb help notebooks`.

### Git Sync

Each notebook can be synced with a remote git repository by setting the
remote URL:

```bash
# set the current notebook's remote to a private GitHub repository
nb remote set https://github.com/example/example.git
```

Any notebook with a remote URL will sync automatically every time a command is
run in that notebook.

When you use `nb` on multiple systems, you can set a notebook on both
systems to the same remote and `nb` will keep everything in sync in the
background every time there's a change in that notebook.

Since each notebook has its own git history, you can have some notebooks
syncing with remotes while other notebooks are only available locally on that
system.

Many services provide free private git repositories, so git syncing with
`nb` is easy, free, and vendor-independent. You can also sync your notes
using Dropbox, Drive, Box, Syncthing, or another syncing tool by changing
your `nb` directory in `nb settings` and git syncing will still work
simultaneously.

When you have an existing `nb` notebook in a git repository, simply
pass the URL to `nb notebooks add` and `nb` will clone your
existing notebook and start syncing changes automatically:

```bash
# create a new notebook named Example cloned from a private GitLab repository
nb notebooks add Example https://gitlab.com/example/example.git
```

Turn off syncing for a notebook by removing the remote:

```bash
# remove the current remote from the current notebook
nb remote remove
```

You can also turn off autosync in `nb settings` and sync manually with
`nb sync`.

### Import / Export

Files of any type can be imported into a notebook. `nb edit` and `nb
open` will open files in your system's default application for that file type.

```bash
# import an image file
nb import ~/Pictures/example.png

# open image in your default image viewer
nb open example.png

# import a .docx file
nb import ~/Documents/example.docx

# open .docx file in Word or your system's .docx viewer
nb open example.docx
```

`nb import` can also download and import files directly from the web:

```bash
# import a PDF file from the web
nb import https://example.com/example.pdf
# Imported 'https://example.com/example.pdf' to 'example.pdf'

# open example.pdf in your system's PDF viewer
nb open example.pdf
```

Some imported file types have indicators to make them easier to identify in
lists:

```bash
> nb ls
home
----
[5] üåÑ example-picture.png
[4] üìÑ example-document.docx
[3] üìπ example-video.mp4
[2] üîâ example-audio.mp3
[1] üìÇ Example Folder
```

Notes can also be exported. If you have Pandoc installed, notes can
be converted to any of the
[formats supported by Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--to).
By default, the output format is determined by the file extension:

```bash
# Export a Markdown note to a .docx Microsoft Office Word document
nb export example.md /path/to/example.docx

# Export a note titled 'Movies' to an HTML web page.
nb export Movies /path/to/example.html
```

### Settings

`nb settings` opens the settings prompt, which provides an easy way to
change your `nb` settings.

```bash
nb settings
```

To update a setting in the prompt, enter the setting name or number,
then enter the new value, and `nb` will add the setting to your
`~/.nbrc` configuration file.

#### Example: editor

`nb` can be configured to use a specific command line editor using the
`editor` setting.

The settings prompt for a setting can be started by passing the setting
name or number to `nb settings`:

```bash
> nb settings editor
[6] editor
    ------
    The command line text editor to use with `nb`.

      ‚Ä¢¬†Example Values: 'vim', 'emacs', 'code', 'subl', 'atom', 'macdown'

EDITOR is currently set to vim

Enter a new value, unset to set to the default value, or q to quit.
Value:
```

A setting can also be updated without the prompt using `nb settings set`:

```bash
# set editor with setting name
> nb settings set editor code
EDITOR set to code

# set highlight color with setting number (6)
> nb settings set 6 code
EDITOR set to code
```

Print the value of a setting:

```bash
> nb settings get editor
code

> nb settings get 6
code
```

Unset a setting and revert to default:

```bash
> nb settings unset editor
EDITOR restored to the default: vim

> nb settings get editor
vim
```

For more information about settings, see [`nb help settings`](#settings-1) and
[`nb settings list --long`](#settings-list---long).

### üé® Color Themes

`nb` has a minimal text interface and uses color to highlight certain
elements like ids, the current notebook name, the shell prompt, and
divider lines.

`nb` includes several built-in color themes and supports user-created color
themes. The color theme can be configured in `notes settings`:

```bash
> nb settings color_theme
[4] color_theme
    -----------
    The color theme. `nb` has several customizable built-in themes,
    listed below.

    Additional themes can be installed in the $NB_DIR/.themes directory.
    Themes have an .nb-theme or .nb-theme.sh extension and contain a
    single if statment assigning the color environment variables to
    tput ANSI color numbers.

      Example:

        # file: ~/.nb/.themes/example.nb-theme.sh
        if [[ "${NB_COLOR_THEME}" == "example" ]]
        then
          export NB_COLOR_PRIMARY=68
          export NB_COLOR_SECONDARY=8
        fi

    To view a list of available color numbers, run `nb settings colors`

    Available themes:

       blacklight, console, desert, electro, forest, monochrome, nb
       ocean, raspberry, unicorn

NB_COLOR_THEME is currently set to nb

Enter a new value, unset to set to the default value, or q to quit.
Value:
```

The primary and secondary colors can also be configured individually,
making the built-in color schemes easily customizable in
`notes settings`. Use `notes settings color_primary` and
`notes settings color_secondary` to open the color settings prompts,
which also both print a table of color values to choose from:

```bash
> nb settings color_primary

[...color table omitted...]

[2] color_primary
    -------------
    The primary color used to highlight identifiers and messages. Often this
    can be set to an xterm color number between 0 and 255. Some terminals
    support many more colors. To view a table of 256 common colors and numbers,
    run: `nb settings colors`
    To view a color for a number, run: `nb settings colors <number>`

      ‚Ä¢¬†Default Value: '68' (blue) for 256 color terminals,
                       '4'  (blue) for  8  color terminals.

NB_COLOR_PRIMARY is currently set to 162

Enter a new value, unset to set to the default value, or q to quit.
Value:
```

#### Shell Theme Support

- [`astral` Zsh Theme](https://github.com/xwmx/astral) - Displays the
    current notebook name in the context line of the prompt.

### Interactive Shell

`nb` has an interactive shell that can be started with `nb shell`,
`nb -i`, or `nb --interactive`:

```bash
$ nb shell
__          _
\ \   _ __ | |__
 \ \ | '_ \| '_ \
 / / | | | | |_) |
/_/  |_| |_|_.__/
------------------
nb shell started. Enter ls to list notes and notebooks.
Enter help for a list of subcommands. Enter exit to exit.
nb> ls
home
----
[3] Example
[2] Sample
[1] Demo

nb> edit 3 --content "New content."
Updated [3] Example

nb> bookmark https://example.com
Added [4] example.bookmark.md 'Example Domain (example.com)'

nb> ls
home
----
[4] üîñ Example Domain (example.com)
[3] Example
[2] Sample
[1] Demo

nb> bookmark url 4
https://example.com

nb> search 'example'
[4] example.bookmark.md 'Example (example.com)'
-----------------------------------------------
1:# Example (example.com)

3:<https://example.com>

[3] example.md 'Example'
------------------------
1:# Example

nb> exit
$
```

The `nb` shell recognizes all `nb` subcommands and options,
providing a streamlined, distraction-free approach for working with `nb`.

### Shortcut Aliases

Several core `nb` subcommands have single-character aliases to make
them faster to work with:

```bash
# `a` (add): add a new note named 'example.md'
nb a example.md

# `b` (bookmark): list bookmarks
nb b

# `o` (open): open bookmark 12 in your web browser
nb o 12

# `p` (peek): open bookmark 6 in your terminal browser
nb p 6

# `e` (edit): edit note 5
nb e 5

# `d` (delete): delete note 19
nb d 19

# `s` (show): show note 27
nb s 27

# `q` (search): search notes for 'example query'
nb q 'example query'

# `h` (help): display the help information for the `add` subcommand
nb h add

# `u` (use): switch to example-notebook
nb u example-notebook
```

If `b` is available on your system, you can add `alias b="bookmark"` to your
`~/.bashrc` or equivalent, which will enable you to:

```bash
# add a new bookmark
b http://example.com

# open bookmark 12
b o 12

# edit bookmark 5
b e 5

# search bookmarks
b q '#example'
```

For more commands and options, run `nb help` or `nb help <subcommand>`

### Subcommands

#### `add`

```text
Usage:
  nb add [<filename> | <content>] [-c <content> | --content <content>]
         [-e | --encrypt] [-f <filename> | --filename <filename>]
         [-t <title> | --title <title>] [--type <type>]

Options:
  -c, --content <content>     The content for the new note.
  -e, --encrypt               Encrypt the note with a password.
  -f, --filename <filename>   The filename for the new note. The default
                              extension is used when the extension is omitted.
  -t, --title <title>         The title for a new note. If `--title` is
                              present, the filename will be derived from the
                              title, unless `--filename` is specified.
  --type <type>               The file type for the new note, as a file
                              extension.

Description:
  Create a new note.

  If no arguments are passed, a new blank note file is opened with
  `$EDITOR`, currently set to 'code'. If a non-option argument is
  passed, `nb` will treat it as a <filename‚â• if a file extension is found.
  If no file extension is found, `nb` will treat the string as
  <content> and will create a new note without opening the editor.
  `nb add` can also create a new note with piped content.

  `nb` creates Markdown files by default. To create a note with a
  different file type, use the extension in the filename or use the `--type`
  option. To change the default file type, use `nb settings`.

  When the `-e` / `--encrypt` option is used, `nb` will encrypt the
  note with AES-256 using OpenSSL by default, or GPG, if configured in
  `nb settings`.

Examples:
  nb add
  nb add example.md
  nb add "Note content."
  nb add example.md --title "Example Title" --content "Example content."
  echo "Note content." | nb add
  nb add -f "Secret Document" --encrypt

  --title     Print the title of the note.

  Show a note. Notes in text file formats can be rendered or dumped to
  standard output. Non-text files will be opened in your system's preferred
  app or program for that file type.

  By default, the note will be opened using `less` or the program configured
  in the `$PAGER` environment variable. Use the following keys to navigate
  in `less` (see `man less` for more information):
